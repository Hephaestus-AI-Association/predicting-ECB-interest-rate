## Presentation
This project was created by Bocconi's **<font color="purple">Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence Association</font>** during Fall 2023 period. In this repository you can find the final paper with a detailed explanation of motivations, execution and results of our research. If you wish to investigate the code we used to conduct our analysis you can find our scripts in [code folder](Hephaestus-AI-Association/predicting-ECB-interest-rate/tree/main/code). Datasets used are available in [datasets folder](Hephaestus-AI-Association/predicting-ECB-interest-rate/tree/main/datasets). Here follows a brief summary of the project.

## Description
In economics, **prediction of data has always had a pivotal role**: interest rates, unemployment and inflation are only some of hundreds of intertwined rates that affect everyone’s lives, directly or indirectly. Indeed, whole areas of finance are concerned with the analysis of past data and events to predict what will happen next: complex mathematical formulas, in-depth analysis of financial statements and ratios, attentions to the news, seeking for a pattern in the past that allows us foresee the future. One of the most important rates, to which every other data is tied, is the **interest rate**. Actually, it does not exist a single or general “interest rate”: each lender can offer a different one, more or less convenient, without affecting more than a few people; the ones everyone is trying to predict are those set by Central Banks. In this study, we are trying to **predict the interest rates set by the European Central Bank** (ECB, in short) that affect directly the eurozone and indirectly the world’s economy.

## Regression Problem
The aim of the project translates in a mathematical framework into a **regression problem** and more generally in the study of **statistical learning** theory which provides a foundational framework within the field of machine learning, integrating principles from statistics and functional analysis. The core objective of statistical learning is to identify an optimal function that captures the systematic relationships between predictors and responses. This function is pivotal for making predictions and drawing inferences. The versatility of statistical learning theory is evident in its applications to regression modeling and data classification. In regression scenarios, that are the one we are interested in, responses are quantitative values within a continuous range, while classification deals with qualitative values from a discrete set of labels. Our task is in the end to **find a function that not only models the training data, but generalizes well to predicting function values at input locations that are not part of the training data**.

## Dataset
For our dataset, we **obtained the data directly from the ECB website**, specifically selecting the list of monthly values of the key economic indicators we were interested in: Interest Rate, Inflation, Business Confidence Index (BCI) (which was later removed from the multiple linear regression due to insufficient correlation with the Interest Rate), Long Term Interest Rate (LT), and Short Term Interest Rate (ST).
